# Computational Modelling and Simulation in Engineering Physics Projects

This repository contains the two projects that I did with my collegues for the Computational Modelling and Simulation in Engineering Physics class in FCT/UNL

For each project there is two folders. The P* folder contains all the files and notes that I used to develod the simulation. The P*-Delivery contains all the files that were sent to the professor for assessment.

In each P*-Delivery folder there is a report (in Portuguese), a V0 code, and a V1 code. The V1 code does the same simulation as the V0 but more optimized and with a lot more features.

**Although all the code is in English, all the prints in the console and the plots shown are in Portuguese.**
